### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Hey ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Jorge, a Bilingual Business Analyst

With 10 years of experience in diverse roles, I developed a strong interest in the business analyst field, which led me to enroll in the TripleTen Business Analytics Bootcamp to further enhance my skills. The completion of this bootcamp has equipped me with advanced data analysis skills and technical proficiency in tools such as SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. This training complements my practical experience and has prepared me to tackle business challenges with a data-driven approach. My background includes overseeing complex construction projects, managing school activities, and maintaining facilities, showcasing my versatility and adaptability in various environments. 

In my role as Extracurricular Activity and Maintenance Manager at Mount View School, I managed procurement and construction projects, coordinated events, and handled financial processes for extracurricular activities. My efforts led to increased student engagement and revenue growth for the school. At Soluciones Integrales, I supervised construction sites, promoted sales, and ensured high standards for building projects. Moving forward, I am ready to use data analytics to drive business decisions and process improvements in a dynamic organization. In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family, working out, hiking, visiting new places, watching movies, series, and sports.
